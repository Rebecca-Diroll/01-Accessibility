# 01-Accessibility

The purpose of this activity is to make the hH website more accessible and simplify the code when possible.

Changes that have been made:

1. Change the tab title to Horiseon.

2. Add a clickable link to the Search Engine Optimization Header text that will take you down to that section on the webpage. The other two header categories were already working correctly.

3. Add alt text to the images.

4. Changed the div and header class to a header tag.
